Sunny is our intrepid snake. She goes up, she goes down, she goes all around. Sunny loves the sun! Thats why Planet Snake also features lighting control. Thats right, during the day she gets healthy dose of UVB as well as extra LED lights targeted towards plant growth and health. During the evening it has a nice healthy blue glow for moon light.
